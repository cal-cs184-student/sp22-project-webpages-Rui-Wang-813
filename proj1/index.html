                        We learned many things from this project, one of such is using what we learn in 
                        linear algerba and apply it to programing and see the result using C++ instead of 
                        Python.

					When the sampling rate is increased to 16, clearly both pixel sampling methods render very smooth 
					images and we do not really see much difference. However, when the sampling rate is 1, the bilinear 
					sampling method renders a much smoother image than nearest sampling method.<br> When the image data is

					sampling method renders better image than the nearest method does.

				<ul>
					<li><b>Speed</b>:
						<ul>
							<li>Super sampling requires sampling multiple times per pixel, and averaging
								down the colors when writing to the frame.
							</li>
							<li>The time cost of Nearest sampling is very small. While in bilinear pixel sampling,
								we generally need to access the memory 4 times, then interpolate the color of the 
								sample. But this should be faster than supersampling in many cases as supersampling
								may require 16 or even more samples per pixel.
							</li>
							<li>
								In this project, level sampling is based on the pixel sampling. Level Zero sampling 
								has little introduction work to do, so it is very close to the pixel sampling it calls.
								 Both Nearest level sampling and bilinear sampling requires calculating the differentials 
								 in uv coordinate w.r.t x and y, and calculating the level based on them. So, the introduction
								  work costs some time. In bilinear level sampling, we have to get the color from two levels 
								and then lerp the result. This costs even more time.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Memory</b>: The only two methods that cost more memory are the <b>supersampling</b> (grid-based or jittered as 
						in ec), and <b>level sampling</b>. In <b>supersampling</b>, we would have to scale up the capacity of the whole 
						sample buffer in order to store the more samples. In <b>level sampling</b>, as we are storing multiple mipmap
						levels, according to mathematics, we need 4/3 of our original memory. (Here the discussion does not include
						memory usage in introduction work pixel sampling or level sampling)						
					</li>
					<li><b>Antialiasing power</b>: In this project, we can get better Antialiasing effect by using higher sampling 
						rate, bilinear pixel and level sampling.
					  <ul>
						<li>
							We think supersampling gives best antialiasing power. Supersampling antialiases in a "greedy" or 
							"brute-force" way. The cost is increasing amount of time and memory usage. It is often times too 
							expensive.
						</li>
						<li>
							Level sampling also has a good antialiasing power. If we keep the same pixel sampling method and switches
							 level sampling method, we can see very clear change. And in nature it resolves the artifacts caused by
							texture with high resolution corresponding to objects far away.
						</li>
						<li>
							Pixel sampling also has some good antialiasing. Actually, how we implemented bilinear pixel sampling 
							reminds us of supersampling in some way. So we think they have similar power with certain sampling rate.
						</li>
					  </ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p1>So, in <b>general</b>, bilinear pixel sampling does not cost much time and memory, but has good 
					antialiasing effect when we use lower cost. Both bilinear and nearest level sampling has a strong antialiasing power 
					for high resolution texture for object of some distance, while level sampling does cost some more time and memory
					usage(but not much, note that mipmap levels only require to 1/3 more memory). Supersampling can be most powerful in 
					antialiasing, but it can also be most expensive.

					I wrote a python script to generate the elements constituting the image in svg file.
					I try to draw a shape with wave-like upper and down boundaries. So I used cosine and sine 
					functions in the range i = [0,600]. I divide i by 10 to make the wave not so radical, and multiply
					the result of the cosine and sine functions by 10 to enlarge the amplitude of the wave. Now I get the 
					1202 points (601 up and 601 down), I construct 600 rectangles out of them, taking every two of the 
					upper points and every two of the down points, and further divide these rectangles into two triangles.
					I made two of this shape. One is filled with grey color, another filled with colors changing from 
					(1,0,0) to (0,0,1) (upper vertices) and (0,1,0) to (1,0,1) (bottom vertices). These 
					triangles are interpolated by the colors at its vertices. <br> What I like of this pair of shapes
					is that it looks like the grey one is the shadow of the colorful one.
